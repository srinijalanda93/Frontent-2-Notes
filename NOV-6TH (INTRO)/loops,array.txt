CONCEPTS covered:Loops,undefined,array (dynamic-push,unshift,pop)
Introduction Of JavaScript...
JAVASCRIPT IS AN INTERPETER
1.DataType
2.Variable-let,const,var.
3.loop in js :for,while,do while
4.functions
5.arrow Funtions.

//DataType read the Accio Job notes
//LOOPS-for,while,do while,foreach

//for loop syntax
for(1;2;3){
    //code
}
-from the above syntax when have 3 statements
1->intialization
2->condition 
3->updation(pre/post increment ,decrement).
=>THE ABOVE 3 STATEMENTS ARE OPTIONAL.

//While Syntax:
while(condition){
    //stmt code
    //updation (optional)
}

//do while syntax:
do{
    //code
    //updation
}while(condition); 
even the condition is false it execute atleast once!!

UNDEFINED: it returns the undefined if the var is declared  but assigned any values
Example:
let a;
console.log(a); //undefined


JS ARRAY ARE "DYNAMIC"+"Heterogeneous"=>Mutable
ARRAY:Collection of Heterogeneous dataTypes stored in a continuous memory allocation 
here it collects the group of data store in a linear Manner
-denoted by [] where each element is separated by commas.
1. always follow the O based indexing (0 to n-1).
2.if the values is not mentioned in the given index return UNDEFINED.
3.for OUTOFBOUND always if we are trying to get the value it return -UNDEFINED.
4.applied same for negative index..-UNDEFINED.

JS ARRAY ARE "DYNAMIC":means we are add and remove the elements
ADD the elements in the ARRAY 
1. add elements at the backside. => arr.push(value1,value2,...) push() is invoking the function.=>O(1)
2. add elements at the frontside. =>arr.unshift(value1,value2,...); 
unshift() =>O(n)

REMOVE the elements in the ARRAY 
1. remove elements at the backside. => arr.pop() pop() is an empty argument O(1)
    pop() also return the deleted element where we store in the var and print
2. remove elements at the frontside. =>arr.shift(); //remove the staring element
   lly like pop returns the deletedElement.

SPLICE METHOD IS used to "add" and "delete" the array from anywhere
1. always return the deleted elements in the form of ARRAY.
SYNTAX Of Splice METHOD

arr.splice(index,count,a,b,c,d,e,f,...);
index:indicates element index /starting indexof the element
count:number of elemnts like1/2/3
->in case count is 0 mean we are not removing the elements.
which is a useful case where we can insert in blw the elements..

a,b,c,d,e,f,...:are the element which are used for adding


-if the count is not mentioned it removes all the element till end
example a=[1,2,3,4,55,"srinija"]
a.splice(2) //[1,2] 
Including  the index 2 all the elements get remove from the array and returns in the form of array..

a.splice(i,0,values);  =>used for the adding the elements in the middle..

SLICE METHOD:used to get the subarray from the main array.
and returns in the form of Array
SYNTAX:arr.slice(startindex,endindex);
                 inclusive,exclusive
