Introduction Of JavaScript...
JAVASCRIPT IS AN INTERPETER
1.DataType
2.Variable-let,const,var.
3.loop in js :for,while,do while
4.functions
5.arrow Funtions.

//DataType read the Accio Job notes
//LOOPS-for,while,do while,foreach

//for loop syntax
for(1;2;3){
    //code
}
-from the above syntax when have 3 statements
1->intialization

=>THE ABOVE 3 STATEMENTS ARE OPTIONAL.

//While Syntax:
while(condition){
    //stmt code
    //updation (optional)
}

    //updation
}while(condition); 
even the condition is false it execute atleast once!!

UNDEFINED: it returns the undefined if the var is declared  but assigned any values
Example:
let a;
console.log(a); //undefined


JS ARRAY ARE "DYNAMIC"+"Heterogeneous"=>Mutable
ARRAY:Collection of Heterogeneous dataTypes stored in a continuous memory allocation 
here it collects the group of data store in a linear Manner
-denoted by [] where each element is separated by commas.
1. always follow the O based indexing (0 to n-1).
2.if the values is not mentioned in the given index return UNDEFINED.
3.for OUTOFBOUND always if we are trying to get the value it return -UNDEFINED.
4.applied same for negative index..-UNDEFINED.

JS ARRAY ARE "DYNAMIC":means we are add and remove the elements
